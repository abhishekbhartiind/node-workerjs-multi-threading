# Worker Threads Module

- The worker_threads module enables the use of threads that execute JavaScript in
  parallel
- Code executed in a worker thread runs in a separate child process, preventing it
  from blocking your main application
- The cluster module can be used to run multiple instances of Node.js that can
  distribute workloads
- worker_threads module allows running multiple application threads within a single
  Node.js instance
